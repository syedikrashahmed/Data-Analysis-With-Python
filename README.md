# Data Analysis With Python

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects completed using Python for the Free Code Camp Course. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of data manipulation, visualization, and statistical computation using popular libraries such as **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Projects

### 1. Demographic Data Analyzer
Performs exploratory analysis on demographic data to extract insights such as income, education, and work patterns using `pandas`.

### 2. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Implements a Python function that calculates key statistical metrics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, sum) for a 3x3 matrix using `NumPy`.

### 3. Medical Data Visualizer
Analyzes and visualizes medical examination data using correlation plots and categorical comparisons.

### 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer
Visualizes daily page views over time using line charts, bar charts, and box plots to identify trends and seasonality.

### 5. Sea Level Predictor
Uses historical sea level data to model and predict future trends through linear regression.
